  caveats <<~EOS
    Sonora is signed ad-hoc rather than notarized, so Gatekeeper refuses to open it
    until the quarantine attribute is cleared. Run this once after installing:

      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "#{appdir}/Sonora.app"

    The sonorahq/sonora nightly workflow updates this cask after every nightly build.
